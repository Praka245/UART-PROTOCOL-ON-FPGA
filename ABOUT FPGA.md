ZedBoard (Zynq-7000 Development Board)
```
## ⚙️ABOUT FPGA BOARD :
- ZedBoard is a low-cost development board based on the AMD Zynq™ - 7000
All Programmable SoC (AP SoC). The board provides all the essential
hardware required to develop systems running Linux®, Android®,
Windows®, or other OS/RTOS-based applications.

- The ZedBoard features a tightly coupled ARM® Cortex™ - A9 processing
system and Xilinx 7-series programmable logic on a single chip,
enabling flexible hardware - software co-design. Multiple expansion
connectors expose both Processing System (PS) and Programmable Logic
(PL) I/O pins, allowing easy user access and peripheral integration.

- This platform enables the development of powerful and customizable
embedded systems by combining high-performance ARM processing with
reconfigurable FPGA logic.
